## 1. Data Types & Storage

**Q: What are the basic data types in C?**
A: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `void`.

**Q: Difference between float and double?**
A: `float` is 4 bytes (single precision), `double` is 8 bytes (double precision).

**Q: What is the size of int, char, float, and pointer in 32-bit vs 64-bit systems?**
A:

* `int`: 4 bytes
* `char`: 1 byte
* `float`: 4 bytes
* `pointer`: 4 bytes (32-bit), 8 bytes (64-bit)

**Q: What is the use of typedef?**
A: Used to create alias names for existing data types. Example: `typedef unsigned int uint;`

---

## 2. Operators & Expressions

**Q: ++i vs i++?**
A: `++i` increments before use, `i++` increments after use.

**Q: Bitwise operators?**
A: `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift).

**Q: Result of sizeof('A')?**
A: 4 (as `'A'` is treated as an `int` in C).

**Q: Use of comma operator?**
A: Evaluates multiple expressions, returns the value of the last one.

---

## 3. Pointers & Memory

**Q: What is a pointer?**
A: A variable that stores the address of another variable.

**Q: *ptr vs &ptr?**
A: `*ptr` dereferences the pointer; `&ptr` gives the address of the pointer.

**Q: Dangling pointer?**
A: Pointer pointing to a freed memory location.

**Q: malloc vs calloc vs realloc vs free?**

* `malloc(size)`: Allocates uninitialized memory.
* `calloc(n, size)`: Allocates zero-initialized memory.
* `realloc(ptr, new_size)`: Resizes previously allocated memory.
* `free(ptr)`: Deallocates memory.

**Q: What is a memory leak?**
A: Memory not freed properly, leading to resource wastage.

**Q: What is a wild pointer?**
A: An uninitialized pointer that contains garbage address.

**Q: What is pointer arithmetic and its limitations?**
A: Operations like addition/subtraction on pointers. Limited to same data type; cannot multiply/divide pointers.

**Q: What are void pointers and their limitations?**
A: Generic pointers that can point to any data type. Cannot be dereferenced without casting; pointer arithmetic not possible.

**Q: Explain the concept of function pointers?**
A: Pointers that point to functions instead of data. Used for callbacks, creating dispatch tables, etc.

**Q: What happens when you dereference a NULL pointer?**
A: Results in a segmentation fault/access violation during runtime.

**Q: What is a near, far, and huge pointer?**
A: Memory model concepts in older C implementations. Near (16-bit), far (32-bit segment:offset), huge (like far but normalized).

**Q: How would you implement a memory pool/allocator?**
A: Pre-allocate a large chunk of memory and manage it manually to reduce malloc/free overhead.

---

## 4. Arrays & Strings

**Q: How are arrays stored in memory?**
A: Contiguously.

**Q: Difference between `char str[] = "abc";` and `char *str = "abc";`?**
A:

* `char[]` allocates on stack.
* `char*` points to a string literal (read-only).

**Q: strlen() vs sizeof()?**
A: `strlen()` counts characters before `\0`. `sizeof()` gives total allocated size.

**Q: What happens when you access an array out of bounds?**
A: Undefined behavior - might cause segmentation fault, corrupt memory, or work incorrectly.

**Q: Can array name be used as a pointer?**
A: Yes, array name decays into a pointer to the first element, but cannot be reassigned.

**Q: What are multi-dimensional arrays in C?**
A: Arrays of arrays, stored in row-major order (e.g., `int arr[3][4]`).

**Q: How to dynamically allocate a 2D array?**
A: Either as array of pointers (`int **arr`) or as contiguous block with pointer arithmetic.

**Q: What is the difference between arrays and linked lists?**
A: Arrays are contiguous with O(1) access; linked lists have non-contiguous elements with O(n) access but flexible size.

**Q: How would you efficiently find duplicate elements in an array?**
A: Using hash tables, sorting followed by linear scan, or bit manipulation (depending on constraints).

**Q: How to pass a 2D array to a function?**
A: Using pointer to array: `void func(int (*arr)[COLS])` or with explicit column size: `void func(int arr[][COLS])`.

**Q: Explain string interning in C?**
A: Compiler optimization where identical string literals share the same memory location.

## 5. Functions

**Q: Call by value vs call by reference?**
A:

* Call by value: Copy of data passed.
* Call by reference: Address passed (via pointers).


**Q: Can you pass an array to a function?**
A: Yes, as a pointer.

---

## 6. Storage Classes

**Q: Storage classes?**
A: `auto`, `extern`, `static`, `register`.

**Q: Use of static in functions/variables?**
A:

* Inside function: Retains value between calls.
* Outside function: Limits scope to file.

---

## 7. Control Flow

**Q: break vs continue vs goto?**
A:

* `break`: Exits loop/switch.
* `continue`: Skips current iteration.
* `goto`: Jumps to a labeled statement.

**Q: Can switch be used with strings?**
A: No, only integral types (char/int).

**Q: Use of default in switch?**
A: Executes when no case matches.

---

## 8. Structures & Unions

**Q: struct vs union?**
A:

* `struct`: All members occupy separate memory.
* `union`: All members share the same memory.

**Q: Memory allocation difference?**
A: `struct` = sum of all members; `union` = size of largest member.

**Q: Can structure contain pointer to itself?**
A: Yes, typically used in linked lists.

---

## 9. File Handling

**Q: File opening modes?**
A: `"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"r+"`, `"w+"`, `"a+"`, `"rb"`, `"wb"`, `"ab"`, etc.

**Q: fscanf vs fgets?**
A: `fscanf` reads formatted input; `fgets` reads a line (safer for strings).

**Q: What's the difference between text and binary file modes?**
A: Text mode translates newlines; binary mode doesn't perform any translations.

**Q: How do you check for end-of-file?**
A: Using the `feof()` function or checking return values of `fread()`, `fscanf()`, etc.

**Q: What is a file pointer?**
A: A pointer to the FILE structure that contains information about the file being accessed.

**Q: How do you move within a file?**
A: Using `fseek()`, `ftell()`, and `rewind()` functions.

**Q: What's the difference between fwrite() and fputs()?**
A: `fwrite()` writes binary data; `fputs()` writes strings.

**Q: How to flush a file stream?**
A: Using `fflush()` function to clear the buffer.

**Q: What happens if you don't close a file?**
A: Resources remain allocated until program termination, potentially causing memory leaks or data loss.

**Q: How to read a file character by character?**
A: Using `fgetc()` or `getc()` functions.

## 10. Compilation & Execution

**Q: Compile-time vs run-time error?**
A:

* Compile-time: Syntax/semantic errors.
* Run-time: Errors during execution (e.g., divide by zero).

**Q: What happens during compilation?**
A: Preprocessing â†’ Compilation â†’ Assembly â†’ Linking â†’ Executable.

**Q: Preprocessor directives?**
A:

* `#define`, `#include`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#undef`

---

## 11. Miscellaneous

**Q: const keyword?**
A: Declares constant values; can't be modified after initialization.

**Q: volatile keyword?**
A: Tells compiler variable can change unexpectedly (used in hardware access, multithreading).

**Q: extern and register?**

* `extern`: Declare a variable defined elsewhere.
* `register`: Suggests variable be stored in CPU register.

**Q: exit() vs return?**
A:

* `return`: Exits function.
* `exit()`: Terminates program.

## 12. Common Coding Questions

```c
// 1. Reverse a string
void reverse(char *str) {
    int i = 0, j = strlen(str) - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        char temp = str[i];
        str[i] = str[j];
        str[j] = temp;
        i++; j--;
    }
}

// 2. Check palindrome
int isPalindrome(char *str) {
    int i = 0, j = strlen(str) - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (str[i++] != str[j--]) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

// 3. Count vowels
int countVowels(char *str) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; str[i]; i++) {
        if (strchr("aeiouAEIOU", str[i])) count++;
    }
    return count;
}

// 4. Swap without temp
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    *a = *a + *b;
    *b = *a - *b;
    *a = *a - *b;
}
```
