## 4. ❌ Deadlocks

### ➤ Conditions for Deadlock:
1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

### ➤ Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)

### ➤ Handling Techniques:
- **Prevention:** Break at least one necessary condition
- **Avoidance:** Banker’s Algorithm, Safe/Unsafe States
- **Detection:** Using RAG and wait-for graphs
- **Recovery:**
  - Process Termination
  - Resource Preemption

- Advantages/Disadvantages

### ➤ Segmentation:
- Segment Table
- Logical Address = (segment no, offset)

### ➤ Paging vs Segmentation

### ➤ Virtual Memory:
- Demand Paging
- Page Faults
- Thrashing
- Working Set Model

### ➤ Page Replacement Algorithms:
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Optimal
- Clock Algorithm

### ➤ Advanced Concepts:
- Multilevel Paging
- Inverted Page Tables
