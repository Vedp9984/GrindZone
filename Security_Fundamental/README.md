# 8. Security Fundamentals

This document covers core topics in web and application security fundamentals, especially relevant for interviews and real-world application development.

## üîê 1. Encryption (SSL/TLS)

### What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using algorithms and keys, so that only authorized parties can access the original data.

### Types of Encryption

* **Symmetric Encryption** (e.g., AES): Same key for encryption and decryption.
* **Asymmetric Encryption** (e.g., RSA): Uses public/private key pair.

### SSL/TLS Protocol

* SSL (deprecated) and TLS are cryptographic protocols that secure communications over the Internet.

### TLS Handshake Steps:

1. Client sends a "Client Hello" with supported cipher suites.
2. Server responds with its certificate and public key.
3. Client verifies certificate, sends a session key encrypted with the server's public key.
4. Both sides derive the same session key.
5. Secure communication begins.

### Key Terms:

* **HTTPS** = HTTP + TLS
* **Certificate Authorities (CA)**: Issue digital certificates
* **Forward Secrecy**: Session key changes with every new session

### Tools:

* `openssl s_client -connect example.com:443`
* Browser lock icon (certificate details)

## üõÇ 2. OAuth & JWT

### OAuth 2.0

A framework for delegated authorization.

#### Key Roles:

* **Resource Owner**: The user
* **Client**: App requesting access
* **Authorization Server**: Issues tokens
* **Resource Server**: API or backend

#### Common Flows:

* **Authorization Code Flow** (most secure)
* **Client Credentials Flow** (for server-to-server)

#### Tokens:

* **Access Token**: Short-lived, used to access APIs
* **Refresh Token**: Used to obtain new access tokens

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

Used for stateless authentication.

#### Structure:

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

* **Header**: Algorithm and token type
* **Payload**: Claims (user ID, roles, exp, etc.)
* **Signature**: Verifies integrity

#### JWT Usage:

* Sent in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
* Stored in localStorage, sessionStorage, or HTTP-only cookies

#### Vulnerabilities:

* `alg: none` attack (never trust input)
* Leaked tokens (no expiration)

## üßç 3. Authentication vs Authorization

| Concept       | Authentication             | Authorization             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Meaning       | Who are you?               | What can you do?          |
| Performed by  | Login systems, biometrics  | Role-based access control |
| Occurs First? | ‚úÖ Yes                      | ‚úÖ After authentication    |
| Data Used     | Username, password, tokens | Roles, policies, ACLs     |

### Authentication Methods:

* Username + password
* OTP, TOTP (Google Authenticator)
* OAuth/OpenID Connect
* Biometric (fingerprint, facial recognition)

### Authorization Methods:

* **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control
* **ABAC**: Attribute-Based Access Control
* ACL: Access Control Lists

## üß® 4. Common Vulnerabilities

### 4.1 SQL Injection

* Attack: Injecting SQL code via input fields
* Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';
```

* Prevention:

  * Use **Prepared Statements** / ORM
  * Sanitize and validate input

### 4.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* Injecting malicious JavaScript into a trusted web page
* Types:

  * Stored
  * Reflected
  * DOM-based
* Example:

```html
<script>alert('Hacked');</script>
```

* Prevention:

  * Escape output
  * Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
  * Sanitize user input

### 4.3 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

* Tricks user into submitting unwanted actions
* Prevention:

  * CSRF tokens in forms
  * SameSite cookies
  * Double submit cookie pattern

### 4.4 Broken Authentication

* Predictable sessions, improper password storage
* Prevention:

  * Use bcrypt/scrypt for password hashing
  * Implement session timeouts
  * MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

### 4.5 Insecure Deserialization

* Leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* Prevention:

  * Avoid unserializing untrusted data
  * Use safe serializers (e.g., JSON over binary)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Best Practices

### Tools:

* **Burp Suite**, **OWASP ZAP** (for penetration testing)
* **Postman** (for token validation)
* **jwt.io** (for decoding JWTs)

### Best Practices:

* Always use HTTPS (TLS)
* Store passwords securely (bcrypt)
* Use secure headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
* Sanitize and validate **all** input
* Implement logging and alerting for unusual activity
* Follow the **Principle of Least Privilege**
